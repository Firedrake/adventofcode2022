For Advent of Code 2022 I'm going to go as far as I can in PostScript.
(Then probably switch to Rust.)

Each PostScript program has two files - the .ps_src is what I actually
write, and the .ps is the result when it's had my library functions
added to it, so the latter is what you'd actually run if by some
desperate mischance you had a need to do so.

Yeah, I wrote a linker for PostScript. Not released yet.
